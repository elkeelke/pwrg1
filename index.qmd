# Abstract

A Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) is performed for a solar district heating community project in Bracht, Rauschenberg, Germany.

# Introduction

Heating is an important topic for energy consumption since it amounts to roughly half of the consumed energy in the EU. Currently, 60% of that energy is generated from fossil fuels as stated in @euroheat2023. District heating is a setup where one heating generator plant serves many households connected via pipes. District heating works in two ways: Either to utilise surplus heat from sources such as waste incineration plants for heating purposes in residential areas and service centres as described by @sfoe2020, or to use a dedicated source of energy, e.g. biomass or solar thermal collectors. There are 6000 existing district heating systems across the EU according to @euroheat2023. Process heating uses a similar setup but is targeted at industrial purposes, which usually require higher heat temperature.

Solar thermal collectors (STCs) are devices that absorb solar radiation and convert it into heat. There are different types of solar thermal collectors, including flat plate solar collectors, unglazed water collectors, and evacuated tube solar collectors. They are combined with heat pumps to bridge the gap between solar field produced water temperature and district heating delivery system required temperature as explained in @wikipedia2020. According to @iea2024, there are more than 300 large scale district heating systems globally that are powered with STCs, and more than 1200 STC systems that provide industrial process heat.

STCs are a mature technology. In 2023, the total operational solar thermal capacity reached 560 GWth, which covers roughly 800 km2 of collector area as stated by @iea2024. STC-provided capacity varies seasonally depending on available sunlight. Sometimes STCs are used only for parts of the year, e.g. to enable turning off a biomass-powered plant in the summer since it would run at extremely low capacity. STCs can be combined with a short term heat storage acting as buffer or a seasonal heat storage tank (e.g. underground hot water basin) to store extra heat from the hot season for the cold season, which incurs heat losses. If space restrictions require such a setup (or if land is cheaper), the geographical location of an STC can be remote from consumers and plants via pipelines (e.g., 4 km in Priština as described in @euroheat2023). However, there is a trade-off since the remote location required laying the necessary pipes underground.

In scientific literature, LCA case studies exist for the district heating system in Milan (see @famiglietti2021environmental) and Marseille (see @vauchez2023life). LCA, in particular the ReCiPe method, has been used to assess the environmental impact of different STC powered district heating configurations by @abokersh2020framework. The outcome was that larger systems that serve many households have a lower environmental impact per energy unit served.

@solano2023life provide an LCA study of a STC plant connected to the Geneva district heat network and find that there is no LCA data available for the coupling of large scale solar thermal installations and district heating networks, and provides suggested numbers that could be used to complement district heat production routes in the KBOB database.

For the community project in Bracht, while the economic viability of the project in comparison to energetic renovation was analysed by @kelch2024comparison, the environmental impact has not yet been studied in detail. This is the subject of the given study.

# Methodology and research questions

The foreground data is collected from various online sources and combined with background data from the Ecoinvent v3 by @wernet2016ecoinvent and UVEK databases \[TBD *How to cite?*\]. The environmental impact is assessed using the mid-point level Environmental Footprint (EF) method recommended in @ec2021EF, and the Ecological Scarcity 2021 v1.04 method defined in @FOEN2021 at the single score level (with UVEK weighting set). The LCIA is performed using the SimaPro 9.6.0.1 software provided by @SimaPro2024. 

The research questions are formulated as follows:

(1) How does the STC based system with seasonal heat storage compare to other heating technologies in terms of environmental impact? The comparison will include district heating from other sources that would be available in small communities (such as a heat pump or wood chips), and consumer side heating installations such as oil or gas boilers. The hypothesis is that the STC based system will have a lower environmental impact compared to other district heating setups and to fossil energy based consumer installations.

(2) What is the environmental impact contribution of the seasonal heat storage unit for the production, construction, and use stages in the life cycle? The benefits of the STC based system with a seasonal heat storage component included will be assessed in comparison to the same system without seasonal heat storage under several assumed loss coefficients for the storage component (sensitivity analysis). The hypothesis is that the seasonal storage component will lower the environmental impact.

(3) What is the relevance of the additional electricity required in the setup (amounting to 6% of overall energy consumed) and the supplemental biomass boiler (amounting to 26% of overall energy consumed) with respect to the overall environmental impact? The hypothesis is that the additional electricity and biomass required will amount to a sizable part of the overall environmental impact.

# Goal and scope

The goal and scope definition of an LCA provides a description of the product system and its system boundaries, and a functional unit.

The district heating project that is the topic of this analysis is led by a cooperative comprising future household consumers and the local council. The project setup consists of a solar thermal collector field, a seasonal storage unit also called Pit Thermal Energy Storage (PTES), a heat pump which is using power from the grid, a buffer storage unit, a backup biomass combustion unit that if required can be used as an alternative source of heat (for the cases where there is no availability of heat from neither the solar collector nor the storage), and a distribution network for the customer households (see @fig-bracht-overview). A receiver unit is installed in each participating household. There are at least 180 consumer households expected, which is roughly 60% of all households in the community.

![Overview of system setup for the Bracht district heating. Source: University of Kassel.](img/bracht_overview.png){#fig-bracht-overview width="75%" fig-border="true"}

The functional unit is 1 kWh of thermal energy (kWh~th~) provided to the consumer directly at the consumer site during the heating period. The lifetime of the installation is assumed to be 50 years. The system diagram shown in @fig-system-diagram describes the product system and its boundaries.

*TBD: Simapro process uses MJ (like the ones used for comparison), doublecheck that this is correct*

![System diagram, with functional unit.](img/system_diagram.png){#fig-system-diagram width="80%" fig-border="true"}

System deconstruction was modeled for the solar thermal collector field and the seasonal storage unit only. *TBD Is this acceptable? It's counted per weight, so the 15t of steel will be the majority, and that is covered*.

*TBD Modelling deconstruction but not recycling (same as for OEBLM). I didn't find an entry for plastic recycling*

*TBD My Simapro process is in the wrong category by mistake. I think I need to re-create everything to fix it. Is it ok to leave as is since it doesn't seem to hurt, or are there any consequences I am not aware of?*

# Life Cycle Inventory (*TBD* *move to Appendix?*)

There is a lot of information available on the project website by @bracht2025. The website has been used as a resource to gather the life cycle inventory data for the five relevant components that are described in the following: solar thermal collector field, seasonal storage unit, heat preparation, distribution infrastructure, and consumer installations.

The planned lifetime for the Bracht plant is 50 years. The assumed individual component lifetimes and the resulting relevant multipliers are shown in @tbl-component-lifetimes. The assumed individual component lifetimes are in line with the assumptions used in @bracht2022.

## Electrical power requirement and loss coefficient assumptions {#sec-loss-coefficients}

Several estimations of annual collector output can be found in the relevant performance data from @tuev2021 for the solar thermal collectors used in this project. They are based on geographical location and on the desired output temperature. The geographically closest matching entry is 5283 kWh per collector per year for the Würzburg location and 75 degrees output. For the given 855 collectors this amounts to an estimated 4.517 MWh per year.

The Bracht documentation @bracht2025faq states that in total, 2.700 MWh per year are expected to reach consumer households. This means that the assumed loss coefficients for the storage unit and in the pipes together is estimated to amount to a significant factor of 40% loss. The electrical power that reaches consumer households is generated to 67% from what the solar thermal collectors generated for storage (2258 MWh), to 26% from biomass (904 MWh), and to 6% from the grid (209 MWh) using the percentage distribution given in @fig-bracht-overview. There is no detailed information how the expected loss was estimated. However, based on the published numbers and an assumed 20% loss coefficient in the pipes, the resulting expected loss in the seasonal storage unit can be calculated at 50%. These assumptions were used in the modelling. Further discussion of loss coefficients and a related sensitivity analysis can be found in @sec-sensitive.

# Results

The results for comparing the solar thermal based district network heat it to other forms of district heating (DH) that are available in small communities such as wood chips (biomass), geothermal heat pump, and also to the usually available consumer side heating installations (CI) such as a oil or gas boiler are shown in @fig-es-single-score and @fig-ef-midpoints.

# Discussion

As shown in @fig-es-single-score, the Bracht setup compares positively to other heating technologies in terms of environmental impact. Based on the analysis using the Ecological Scarcity 2021 v1.04 method with UVEK weighting set, it shows a lower environmental impact compared to other relevant district heating setups and to fossil energy based consumer installations. The results visualize that the Bracht system fares better in the "Main air pollutants and Particulate Matter (PM)" category in comparison to a completely wood chips based energy source for district heating, while the impact from the biomass energy used in the Bracht system is still visible in the results. The geothermal based district heating would perform better if there wasn't as much radioactive waste to deposit. The gas and oil based customer installations compare the least well in the selection because of the high impacts in the global warming category.

Related results are shown in @fig-ef-midpoints when looking at the Environmental Footprint Method. Again the wood chips based energy source for district heating fares worst in the particulate matter category. It is also returning the worst results for land use, euthrophication (marine and terrestrial), human toxicity (cancer), and photochemical ozone formation. The oil burner returns the worst results for acidification, climate change, freshwater ecotoxicity, human toxicity (non-cancer), and fossil resource use. The gas burner shows bad results for climate change and ozone depletion. The geothermal heat pump district heating is performing badly for euthrophication (freshwater) and for ionising radiation. The solar thermal based district heating returns the worst results for resource use (minerals and metals).

@fig-network-pie reveals that the environmental impact contribution of the seasonal heat storage unit are minimal. The only component that is listed is the Polystyrene from the floating cover of the seasonal heat storage unit, which amounts to 2% of the overall impact. The seasonal storage component lowers the environmental impact very significantly since it avoids using more heat from wood chips and electricity, which are the two biggest contributors to overall environmental impact. The plan for this research was to assess the impact of not using a seasonal storage component in the setup. However, the results shown in @fig-network-pie make it very clear that the seasonal storage component is essential for the overall system while its environmental impact is minimal. Therefore, the effects of not using a seasonal storage component in the setup were not analysed further.

The additional electricity and biomass required were expected to play a big role with respect to the overall environmental impact. But it is surprising to see that these two are the biggest contributors. The electricity use can not be avoided since it is required to run the heat pump. Its impact can be lowered by using green energy *TBD should it be assessed too? (It's clear that using green energy will make the results much better. Electricity modelling currently very simple, using "electricity mix, winter 2018/CH")*. The opportunities and effects of using less biomass by lowering heat loss coefficients is assessed in detail in @sec-sensitive.

## Loss coefficients and sensitivity analysis {#sec-sensitive}

Heat is harder to transport than electrical power since even good insulation cannot avoid losses of radiating heat. There are two main areas where heat losses occur in the setup: in the pipes, and in the seasonal storage unit. Therefore, the loss coefficients assumed for the pipes and for the storage unit are highly relevant to the modelling.

As summarized by @werner2017international, the relevant parameters affecting heat loss in the pipes are the length of the network which depends on the transmission distance relative to demand, the system age, and the operating temperature. The cited loss coefficient numbers for pipe loss range between 5% and 35%. The Bracht setup has a long transmission distance of 8800 meters because of the rural setup, and a planned operating temperature of 85 degrees Celsius. Both of these factors affect performance negatively. Therefore, even if the system is brand new and therefore modern, assuming a 20% heat loss is realistic. The open source modelling tool Energy Transition Model by @etm2025 suggests 15% as a sensible default for modelling heat loss in the pipes of modern district heating networks based on real world numbers. Note that in the comparison in @fig-es-single-score, the data for the other energy sources for district heating (wood chips, heatpump) used a 5% to 10% assumption which means that the solar thermal data with the 20% assumption is disadvantaged in the comparison.

If the heat loss in the Bracht pipes could be lowered to 10% by using a lower operating temperature, that would result in efficiency savings of 335 MWh per year which would in turn not require production from the biomass boiler. This is significant since it amounts to roughly one third of the energy coming from biomass. @fig-es-sensitivity-pipes shows that this results in a reduction from 39 to 34 Ecopoints per MJ of district heat, which amounts to a 12% reduction. The main impact factor changed is in the "Main air pollutants and Particulate Matter (PM)" category.

![Potential savings when halfing heat loss in pipes.](img/pwrg_solar_es_sensitivity_pipes.png){#fig-es-sensitivity-pipes width="100%"}

@penttinen2021optimal report a 26% loss of heat production in the storage unit amounted to of heat production. The Energy Transition Model by @etm2025 suggests 30% as a sensible default for modelling heat loss in the storage unit. @xiang2022comprehensive provide a comprehensive review and find that 30% to 50% heat loss are common for Pit Thermal Energy Storage and that the majority of losses are caused by floating cover. The assumption for Bracht, which is 50% loss, seems to be on the conservative side. If it can be lowered to 30%, which seems feasible given the scientific results cited, that would cancel out the entirety of energy from biomass required. This would reduce the environmental impact from 39 to 26 Ecopoints per MJ of district heat, which is a reduction of 33%, as shown in @fig-es-sensitivity-storage.

# Conclusion

A case study life cycle assessment was performed for the solar district heating community project in Bracht, Rauschenberg, Germany. The results compare favorably to other heating technologies in terms of environmental impact. To further improve, the recommendations are (1) to consider a lower operating temperature for the system to achieve better overall efficiency through avoided heat losses, (2) to use green energy for running the heat pump, and (3) to lower or event completely remove the amount of biomass burnt by improving the heat loss coefficients for storage unit and transmission pipes.
