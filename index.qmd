# Abstract

A Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was conducted for a solar district heating community project in Bracht, Germany, which incorporates solar thermal collectors, a seasonal heat storage unit powered through an included electric heat pump, a supplemental biomass boiler as a backup solution for when there is no heat available from the solar based system, and a transport network to supply residential consumers. 

The assessment used standard environmental impact methods to evaluate the system over a 50-year lifetime, based on the energy delivered. Despite supplying the majority of the energy, the solar thermal component with seasonal storage contributed less than 30% to the overall environmental impact. Instead, the biomass backup and electricity sourced from the grid accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total impact, even though they provided only one-third of the energy. 

The results are encouraging and show that the Bracht system is environmentally favorable compared to many alternatives. However, substantial potential for improvement through optimization of the system’s operating conditions remains. Key opportunities include using renewable electric energy for the heat pump, and reducing heat losses in storage and transport to minimize, or even completely eliminate, the need for supplemental biomass. This is achievable by optimizing settings such as the system's operating temperature.

# Introduction and related work

Heating is a key contributor to energy consumption, accounting for roughly half of all energy used in the EU, with 60% of that energy still generated from fossil fuels @euroheat2023. District heating is a system in which a central heating plant supplies heat to multiple households through a network of pipes. District heating works in two main ways: it either utilizes surplus heat from sources such as waste incineration plants to provide heating for residential areas and service centers @sfoe2020, or it relies on dedicated energy sources such as biomass or solar thermal collectors. There are approximately 6,000 district heating systems operating across the EU @euroheat2023. Process heating follows a similar setup but is designed for industrial applications, which typically require higher temperatures. 

Studies such as @jeandaux2021life have shown that using a centralized heating system with a heat distribution network results in a lower environmental impact compared to standalone heating units installed at each consumer’s site.

Solar thermal collectors (STCs) are devices that absorb solar radiation and convert it into heat. There are several types of STCs, including flat plate collectors, unglazed water collectors, and evacuated tube collectors. These systems are often combined with heat pumps to bridge the temperature gap between the water produced by the solar field and the temperature required by the district heating delivery system @wikipedia2020. According to @iea2024, there are more than 300 large-scale district heating systems worldwide powered by STCs, and over 1.200 STC systems that provide industrial process heat.

Solar thermal collectors are a mature technology. In 2023, the total operational solar thermal capacity reached 560 GWth, covering roughly 800 km² of collector area @iea2024. STC-provided capacity varies seasonally depending on available sunlight. In some cases, STCs are used only during certain parts of the year, for example to allow a biomass-powered plant to shut down during summer when it would otherwise operate at extremely low capacity.

STCs can be combined with short-term heat storage that acts as a buffer, or with seasonal heat storage tanks, sometimes referred to as Pit Thermal Energy Storage (PTES). These include underground hot water basins that store excess heat from the warm season for use in the cold season. However, this setup involves heat losses.

If space limitations or land costs require it, STCs can be installed at a distance from consumers and heat plants, with pipelines connecting them. An example is Priština, where the distance is around 4 km @euroheat2023. This introduces a trade-off, as the remote location requires laying additional underground piping.

In scientific literature, only a small number of LCIA case studies for district heating systems exist, such as those for the systems in Milan @famiglietti2021environmental and Marseille @vauchez2023life. Life Cycle Impact Assessment, particularly based on the ReCiPe method, has been used to evaluate the environmental impact of different STC-powered district heating configurations by @abokersh2020framework. Their findings indicate that larger systems serving many households tend to have a lower environmental impact per unit of energy delivered. In @solano2023life, the authors present an LCIA study of an STC plant connected to the Geneva district heating network.

For the community district heating project in Bracht, the economic viability in comparison to conventional energetic renovation measures has been assessed in a previous study @kelch2024comparison. However, the environmental impact of the project has not yet been examined in detail. This gap forms the focus of the present study.

# Methodology and research questions {#sec-metho}

The LCIA was performed using the SimaPro 9.6.0.1 software @SimaPro2024. The foreground data was collected from various online sources and combined with background data from the Ecoinvent v3 database @wernet2016ecoinvent and the UVEK LCI database version DQRv2:2025 @FOEN2025. The environmental impacts were assessed using the mid-point level Environmental Footprint (EF) method @ec2021EF and the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method @FOEN2021 at the single score level with UVEK LCI weighting set. 

The research questions were formulated as follows:

1.  What is the relevance of the additional electricity required in the setup (amounting to 6% of overall energy consumed) and the supplemental biomass boiler (amounting to 26% of overall energy consumed) with respect to the overall environmental impact? The hypothesis is that the additional electricity and biomass required will amount to a sizable part of the overall environmental impact.
2.  How does the STC based system with seasonal heat storage compare to other heating technologies in terms of environmental impact? The comparison will include district heating from other sources that would be available in small communities (such as a heat pump or wood chips), and consumer side heating installations such as oil or gas boilers. The hypothesis is that the STC based system will have a lower environmental impact compared to other district heating setups and to fossil energy based consumer installations.
3.  What is the environmental impact contribution of the seasonal heat storage unit in the production, construction, and use stages in the life cycle? A sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess the benefits of the STC based system with a seasonal heat storage component included under several assumed loss coefficients for the storage component and the transport pipe system. The hypothesis is that the seasonal storage component will lower the environmental impact.

The following chapters will cover all the necessary stages of the LCIA: goal and scope definition in @sec-goal, inventory analysis in @sec-lci-overview, impact assessment in @sec-results, and interpretation in @sec-inter.

# Goal and scope {#sec-goal}

The goal and scope definition is a fundamental step in any Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), as it provides a clear description of the product system under study, its system boundaries, and the definition of a functional unit that reflects the output of the system in a consistent and measurable way. 

![System overview for the Bracht community district heating network. (Source: University of Kassel)](img/bracht_overview.png){#fig-bracht-overview width="75%" fig-border="true"}

For the present LCIA, the specific goals are to address the research questions outlined in Section @sec-metho. The scope of the assessment encompasses a district heating project initiated and operated by a cooperative composed of future household consumers and the local municipal council. As illustrated in Figure @fig-bracht-overview, the system includes the following key components:

*   solar thermal collector (STC) field,
*   seasonal storage unit (SSU),
*   heat pump (HP) component with heat pump powered by electricity from the grid and a buffer storage unit
*   biomass combustion unit serving backup heat when stored heat is unavailable,
*   a facility to house the heat pump and the biomass combustion unit,
*   heat transport (HT) distribution network that supplies to residential consumers, and
*   and receiver units installed in each participating household.

The lifetime of the district heating system is assumed to be 50 years. There are at least 180 consumer households expected, which is roughly 60% of all households that exist in the local community. The plant is currently under construction and on track to be operational for the 2025 winter heating period. 

The system diagram shown in @fig-system-diagram describes the product system and its boundaries. The functional unit is defined to be 1 MegaJoule (MJ) of thermal energy provided to the consumer directly at the consumer site during the heating period. Using MJ instead of kilowatt-hours of thermal energy (kWh~th~) ensures consistency with the UVEK processes for other forms of district heating in SimaPro that the comparison will be performed against.

# Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {#sec-lci-overview}

This section outlines the foundational data used to support system modelling. Extensive project-related information for the Bracht community district heating system is available on the project website @bracht2025. This was used extensively as a key source for detailed LCI data. It provided detailed data on the solar thermal collector field, the seasonal storage unit, and heat preparation systems comprising the heat pump, buffer storage, installation facility, and consumer installations. 
 
The comparison datasets and the heat transport network were modelled based on UVEK LCI data @FOEN2025, an existing resource for conducting LCIAs of energy systems and infrastructure within Switzerland and the broader European context provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (abbreviated in English as SFOE, and in German as UVEK). For electricity input, the modelling assumed the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) production mix, also provided in the UVEK dataset, to ensure the model reflects conditions typical of a plant operating within the European region.

Additional LCI details for all components are provided in @sec-lci. Detailed specifications and parameters of the resulting system model are described in @sec-sima. The remainder of this section outlines the key assumptions regarding component lifetimes, expected electricity demand, and thermal loss coefficients.

## Component lifetimes

The planned lifetime for the Bracht plant is 50 years. The assumed individual component lifetimes and the resulting relevant multipliers are shown in @tbl-component-lifetimes. The assumed individual component lifetimes are in line with the assumptions used in @bracht2022.

## Electrical power requirements and loss coefficient assumptions {#sec-loss-coefficients}

Performance data from @tuev2021 provides several estimates of the annual output for the solar thermal collectors used in this project. These estimates vary by geographic location and desired output temperature. The most geographically relevant data point is for Würzburg, with an output of 5.283 kWh per collector per year at a target output temperature of 75 degrees Celsius (°C). Given a total of 855 collectors, the estimated gross thermal energy production is approximately 4.517 MWh per year.

According to the project documentation @bracht2025faq, 2.700 MWh per year are expected to reach end-user households. This implies a total system loss of approximately 40%, accounting for thermal losses in the storage unit and distribution piping.

The energy distribution for heating supply is reported in @fig-bracht-overview as follows:

*   67 % from stored solar thermal energy (approximately 2.258 MWh),
*   26 % from biomass sources (approximately 904 MWh), and
*   6 % from the electricity grid (approximately 209 MWh)

Since detailed methods for the loss estimates used in the Bracht assumptions are not provided in the public documentation, the modelling described in this document assumes a 20% loss coefficient as the default for the heat transmission pipe network. The relevant literature and further rationale for the choice are presented in @sec-pipe-loss. Given this assumption, the implied thermal loss within the seasonal storage unit would be approximately 50% to align with the reported figures from @bracht2025faq. These assumptions were incorporated into the system model as the default values. More background and a detailed discussion of thermal loss coefficients and their influence on system performance is presented in the sensitivity analysis in @sec-sensitive-loss.

# Results {#sec-results}

The system model, as detailed in @sec-sima, was implemented using SimaPro @SimaPro2024. This model served as the foundation for generating LCIA results using the Environmental Footprint (EF) method @ec2021EF and the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method @FOEN2021. The corresponding results derived from these assessments are presented in this section.

![Relative environmental impact for components of Bracht community district heating system  (Ecological Scarcity 2021, v1.04, UVEK LCI weighting)](img/pwrg_solar_network_bar.png){#fig-network-bar width="80%"}

To address the first research question regarding the environmental impact of the additional electricity and the supplemental biomass burnt in the wood boiler, the relative influence of the individual components of the solar thermal district heating system on overall environmental impact was evaluated using the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method. The assessment was conducted at the single-score level, applying the UVEK LCI weighting set to define the relative importance of the different damage categories. The results are presented in @fig-network-bar. They show that the biomass (27.3 %) and the electricity (35.8 %) together have a very large impact. They are responsible for nearly two-thirds of the environmental impact of the overall system. The solar thermal based part of the system with solar thermal field, seasonal storage, and heat pump is responsible for less than 30 % of the overall environmental impact, although they supply two-thirds of the total energy production (see @fig-bracht-overview). Only one-third of the energy delivered to end consumers originates from the biomass and electricity.

For a more detailed view of the environmental impact by individual damage categories, @fig-ef-network-bar presents the drilled-down individual results for the most relevant impact categories *Climate change*, *Particulate matter*, *Eutrophication (marine)*, *Land use*, *Resource use (minerals and metals)*, and *Resource use (fossils)*. The figure shows that biomass combustion is the dominant contributor to Land use, Particulate matter, and Marine eutrophication. In contrast, electricity use is the primary driver of impacts in *Fossil resource use* and *Climate change*. The environmental impact in the *Minerals and metals resource use* category is most significantly influenced by heat preparation and the solar thermal collectors. The seasonal storage unit contributes notably to the *Climate change* category.

![Relative environmental impact of Bracht community district heating network system components (Environmental Footprint Method)](img/pwrg_solar_ef_network_bar_faceted.png){#fig-ef-network-bar width="90%"}

In summary, electricity and biomass used to operate and supplement the system are the primary contributors to the overall environmental impact. Electricity consumption is unavoidable due to the operation of the heat pump. However, its impact can potentially be mitigated by sourcing electricity from renewable sources instead of the ENTSO-E production mix (as described in @sec-lci-overview), an option explored in more detail in @sec-sensitive-elec. Strategies to reduce biomass consumption by improving thermal efficiency, such as lowering heat loss coefficients, are examined in @sec-sensitive-loss.

To address the second research question, the environmental impact of heat generated by the solar thermal collector based district heating system with seasonal heat storage was compared to that of other heating technologies. The results, presented in @fig-es-single-score, show a comparison of the environmental impacts of STC-based district heating with other district heating (DH) options commonly available in small communities, such as systems powered by wood chips (biomass) or geothermal heat pumps. Additionally, the analysis includes consumer-side heating installations (CI), such as oil and gas boilers. The assessment was conducted using the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method at the single-score level, applying the UVEK LCI weighting set. Results are expressed in environmental impact points (Pt) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of heat delivered.

![Comparison of environmental impact of Bracht community district heating network to other energy sources for district heating such as wood chips and heat pump, and to consumer installations such as gas and oil burners (Ecological Scarcity 2021 v1.04, UVEK LCI weighting). Results in ascending order: district heating based on wood chips 165 Pt per kWh, as the energy source, Bracht solar thermal based district heating 170 Pt per kWh, district heating based on geothermal heat pump 225 Pt per kWh, gas based consumer installation 281 Pt per kWh, oil based consumer installation 430 Pt per kWh.](img/pwrg_solar_es_single_score.png){#fig-es-single-score width="80%"}

The result is that the heat produced by the Bracht plant with 170 Pt per kWh of heat shows the second lowest environmental impact compared to the other heating technologies. The largest contributor is the *Global warming* category, dominantly caused by the electricity required (ENTSO-E production mix as discussed in @sec-lci-overview) and to a lesser extent by the seasonal storage unit and the solar thermal collectors (cf. @fig-ef-network-bar). 

The results indicate that heat produced by the Bracht plant, with an environmental impact of approximately 170 Pt per kilowatt-hour, exhibits the second lowest impact among the heating technologies assessed. The dominant contributor to this impact is the *Global warming* category, primarily driven by electricity consumption, based on the ENTSO-E production mix as detailed in @sec-lci-overview, and to a lesser extent by the seasonal storage unit and the solar thermal collectors (see @fig-ef-network-bar).

The lowest environmental impact with 165 Pt per kWh of heat is returned for the district heating system based on wood chips as the energy source, even with the impact on main air pollutants and particulate matter (PM) having a significant impact on the overall results for this setup.  The district heating system based on a geothermal heat pump as the energy source has the third lowest impact with 225 Pt per kWh of heat, to the largest extent from impact on radioactive waste to deposit. Oil and gas based consumer installations fare worse with 430 Pt and 281 Pt per kWh of heat, dominantly from impact on climate change.

![Damage assessment using the Environmental Footprint Method, visualized as relative environmental impacts in comparison.](img/pwrg_solar_ef_midpoints_faceted.png){#fig-ef-midpoints width="90%"}

As before, @fig-ef-midpoints presents the individual results for the most relevant damage categories, comparing them relative to the highest value in each category, which is shown as the longest bar representing 100% relative impact. This analysis confirms the findings from @fig-es-single-score, clearly demonstrating that oil and gas boilers have extremely high impacts in the *Climate change* category which is equivalent to Global warming in the Ecological Scarcity method with relative impacts of 100% and 70%, respectively. Additionally, oil and gas boilers exhibit the highest fossil resource use, at 100% and 80%. 

A clear trade-off exists because each heating technology performs worst in different impact categories. For example, the district heating network using wood chips shows lower climate change impacts but the highest relative impacts in *Marine eutrophication*, *Land use*, and *Particulate matter* (PM). While PM impact was visible in @fig-es-single-score, *Marine eutrophication* and *Land use* impacts were not significant in the single score results. Similarly, solar thermal and geothermal-based district heating systems have the highest relative impacts in Minerals and metals resource use, at 100% and 83%, respectively. These trade-offs imply that selecting a heating technology depends on which environmental impacts are prioritized for a given use case. This highlights the need to weigh and balance different categories manually, or to rely on a single score method if applicable.

# Interpretation and discussion {#sec-inter} 

This chapter discusses the results introduced in @sec-results. They revealed that the district heating system based on solar thermal energy and seasonal storage compares favorably to other means of heating. However, in the given modelling, with limitations as documented in @sec-model-limitation, it exhibits higher environmental impact compared to the district heating system based on wood chips as the energy sources. The electricity and the supplemental biomass required were found to be the two top single contributors to the overall results. To understand the saving potential from using lower-emitting (see @sec-sensitive-elec) or less energy resources (see third research question and @sec-sensitive-loss), sensitivity analyses for source of electricity and loss coefficients for the heat loss in the seasonal storage unit and the transport pipes will be performed.

## Modelling limitations {#sec-model-limitation}

The UVEK data for the other energy sources for district heating (wood chips, heat pump) used an 11 % assumption which means that the solar thermal data with the 20% assumption as mentioned in @sec-loss-coefficients is disadvantaged in the comparison in @fig-es-single-score. The effect of these assumptions on the results will be investigated in @sec-sensitive-loss.

Data availability was generally satisfactory with one notable exception for the modelling of the heat pumps used in the system (see @sec-hp for specifications). There are two heat pumps with 630 kW max electrical input power each used in the system, but in the UVEK data, the largest sized heat pump available has a maximum of 50 kW power. The best possible assumption in this situation was that the two large heat pump have the same impact as 25 units of the 50 kW heat pump, but this is likely leading an overestimation of the resource use for minerals and metals. This is acceptable since with 6.1 %, the heat preparation system which includes the heat pump showed only minor impact on the overall results (see @fig-network-bar).

Worth mentioning is that the UVEK data for the transport system district heat has a lifetime assumption of 30 years whereas the Bracht setup assumes 50 years. This is acceptable since with 6.6 %, the heat transport system showed only minor impact on the overall results (see @fig-network-bar). 

There was a problem with the weights for the damage category *Water resources, net balance* in the UVEK LCI weighting set that required excluding this category from the analysis. 

System deconstruction was modeled for the major infrastructure components, specifically the solar thermal collector field and the seasonal storage unit. The model includes the disposal of plastic materials used for sealing and insulation in the seasonal storage unit, assuming treatment via municipal waste incineration. For the remaining system components only deconstruction processes were included in the model. Final disposal or material recovery for these components was not considered within the scope of this analysis (cf. system diagram in @fig-system-diagram).

## Sensitivity analysis: Source of electricity {#sec-sensitive-elec}

The results as presented in @fig-es-single-score indicate that the dominant environmental impact arises from the electricity demand of the system, which originates from the heat pump. In the default model, the electricity mix was modeled based on the ENTSO-E production mix @FOEN2025. This includes a built-in assumption that the electricity production mix will remain constant over the lifetime of the plant. In this section, the effects of the default choice for the modelling as well as potentially achievable savings by using lower-emitting electricity are assessed.

There are two specific aspects of the given use case that need to be considered:

* Electricity consumption primarily occurs during the winter months, when electricity production conditions differ significantly from those in the summer months (e.g., reduced output of photovoltaic systems).
* The plant is assumed to have a lifetime of 50 years, which means it is expected to be decommissioned around 2075. Given the European Union’s commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, significant changes in the environmental impact of electric energy can be anticipated over the plant’s operational period.

<!--To grasp an understanding of the effect of winter conditions on environmental impact of the grid mix, the relevant UVEK-supplied data for operation of storage pumps for hydro plants in winter in several European countries based on energy production technology shares originating from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform @entsoe_transparency was analysed. Note that these data sets are not directly applicable since the use case is different, but can be used to provide first insights into environmental impact of winter electricity production mix. The relevant data for Germany and Switzerland was used for the analysis. The results show an improvement from 170 Pt per kWh of heat when assuming the ENTSO-E production mix to 166 Pt per kWh of heat for Germany and 145 Pt per kWh of heat for Switzerland based on analysis using the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method. While the exact numbers are not representative, the main insight gathered is that producing winter energy under equal or lower environmental impact than the ENTSO-E production mix is generally feasible in Germany and Switzerland.-->

While attempting to assess the impact of future grid decarbonization, it became apparent that no readily available dataset exists with projections about the future energy grid in Europe that could be directly applied for the analysis. Consequently, the remainder of this section focuses on the planned future for the Swiss energy grid. The most reliable sources of information are provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy’s Energy Perspectives 2050+ report @bfe2022energieperspektiven and its accompanying resources including charts @bfe2022energieperspektivencharts and data tables @bfe2020dataset). Particularly relevant are the projections for the expected winter electricity production mix at five-year intervals from 2025 to 2060, as depicted in @fig-ch-winter-prod. 

![Expected production mix for winter period (6 months) in Switzerland from 2025 to 2060 (Source: Swiss Federal Office for Energy).](img/pwrg_solar_ch_winter.png){#fig-ch-winter-prod width="80%"}

Based on this data, the anticipated energy mix over the operational lifetime of the Bracht plant was calculated as summarized in @tbl-ch-projection. Since no projections are available beyond 2060, the values from 2060 were assumed to remain constant through 2075. Detailed information about the origin and type for Switzerland’s imported electricity during the winter was missing from the primary dataset. Therefore, an additional dataset from the World Bank @WorldBankWITS2023 was used for determine the country-wise distribution of electricity imports. According to this dataset, electricity imports in 2023 originated primarily from France (60.2%), Germany (23.1%), Austria (14.4%), and Italy (2.3%). The low voltage production mix in these countries was assumed for modelling. There was no specific data for geothermal and waste water based electricity. These were substituted with hydro power based electricity, due to its comparable environmental impact profile.

:::

Based on the projected future grid mix from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy and evaluated using the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method, the environmental impact of operating such a plant in Switzerland is estimated to average 130 Pt per kWh of heat over its lifetime.

To reduce this impact further, the Bracht plant could consider to purchase renewable electricity. Using exclusively wind power would lower the environmental impact to 113 Pt per kWh of heat, while relying solely on hydropower would result in 115 Pt per kWh. In both cases, the environmental footprint associated with the plant's electricity demand would be largely offset. For comparison, in a hypothetical scenario with no electricity requirement at all, the environmental impact would be 109 Pt per kWh of heat.

## Sensitivity analysis: Loss coefficients {#sec-sensitive-loss}

Heat is harder to transport than electrical power since even good insulation cannot avoid losses of radiating heat. There are two main areas where heat losses occur in the setup: in the pipes, and in the seasonal storage unit. Therefore, the loss coefficients assumed for the pipes and for the storage unit are highly relevant to the modelling. The impact of changes in these loss coefficients assumptions will be assessed in @sec-pipe-loss and @sec-ssu-loss.

### Pipe heat loss {#sec-pipe-loss}

As summarized in @werner2017international, the key parameters affecting heat loss in district heating pipes include the length of the network which depends on the transmission distance relative to demand, the system age, and the operating temperature. The relevant heat loss coefficients reported range between 5 % and 35 %. The Bracht setup involves a relatively long transmission distance of 8800 meters due to its rural context. The planned supply temperature of 85 degrees °C is relatively high and will contribute to increased thermal losses. In contrast, modern district heating systems can operate with lower supply temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees °C to minimize heat loss and improve efficiency as noted by @lund2020districtheating.

The rationale behind selecting a default heat loss rate of 20 % for the Bracht setup reflects the combined negative impact of the long transmission distance and high operating temperature on system performance. However, several sources assume lower loss rates. For example, the open source Energy Transition Model @etm2025 suggests a 15 % default loss figure based on real world data for modern district heating networks. The Swiss Federal Office of Energy UVEK assumes an even lower rate of approximately 11 % in its district heating data.

If the Bracht system was optimized to achieve heat loss rates comparable to the UVEK assumption, e.g. by lowering the operating temperature, annual efficiency gains of about 300 MWh could be realized. This would remove one-third of the  requirements planned to be supplied via biomass, which would correspond to a 9 % reduction in ecological impact from 170 Pt per kWh to 155 Pt per kWh of heat produced according to the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method at the single score level with UVEK LCI weighting. The most significant reductions can be achieved in the *Main air pollutants and Particulate Matter (PM)* category, primarily due to the reduced combustion of biomass.

### Seasonal storage unit heat loss {#sec-ssu-loss}

In @penttinen2021optimal, the authors report a 26% loss of heat production in the storage unit amounted to of heat production. The Energy Transition Model @etm2025 suggests 30% as a sensible default for modelling heat loss in the storage unit. Another study @xiang2022comprehensive provides a comprehensive review and finds that 30% to 50% heat loss are common for Pit Thermal Energy Storage and that the majority of losses are caused by floating cover. 

Given these reference numbers from literature, the 50% loss assumption that was used for the Bracht plant is on the conservative side. For the sensitivity analysis, the assumption made is that it can potentially be lowered to 30% based on two different scenarios: (A) without any changes in the setup but an understanding that the original assumptions were not accurate, and (B) by using twice the cover for the top of seasonal storage unit and therefore better insulation. The sides and the bottom of the seasonal storage unit remain unchanged. 

In both scenarios, a significantly higher amount of energy is available from the seasonal storage unit because of the lower heat loss as shown in @tbl-loss. In the original scenario, out of the 4.517 MWh produced by the solar thermal collectors, an amount of 2.259 MWh remains available from the seasonal storage unit after accounting for assumed losses. When heat losses are reduced, the available energy increases substantially to 3.162 MWh. The difference of 900 MWh is equal in size to the contribution that was expected to be supplied via biomass combustion in the default model. Therefore, the opportunity exists to lower the environmental impact of the system by removing the parts that stem from biomass. These have a significant impact as shown in @sec-results.

::: {#tbl-loss .table caption="SSU heat loss"}
| Scenario    | Dimension | Value     | Assumed loss | Electricity requirements |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| all         | Produced  | 4.517 MWh |  -           |
| default     | Available | 2.259 MWh | 50%          | 209 MWh (Factor 0.092)
| (A) and (B) | Available | 3.162 MWh | 30%          | 293 MWh (Factor 0.092)
:::

However, the higher availability of energy in the seasonal storage unit results in a modified heat supply curve and in heightened electrical energy requirements for the heat pump since it will be used more extensively in the system instead of the biomass boiler. An in-depth analysis of the implications would require additional modelling tools such as @polysun, which is out of scope for the given work. As a simplification, a rough estimate of the heightened energy requirements was carried based the factor between energy from the seasonal storage unit and energy from electricity from the original assumptions (see @tbl-loss): 209 MWh divided by 2.258 MWh, which returns a 9.2 % electricity requirement factor. Note that this corresponds to a COP of 11 which is indicative for a highly performant system. This was considered plausible, because the initially very high temperature in the seasonal storage unit (85 degrees °C) at begin of the heating periods means that the heat pump will not be required to bridge the temperature gap until the temperature are falling to lower levels. The rough estimate based on the electricity requirement factor as described results in a 293 MWh electricity demand for the heat pump (40 % increase). 

Both scenarios were modeled in SimaPro to learn about the implications on environmental impact. Like in the default model, the ENTSO-E production mix was assumed. For scenario (A) with updated assumptions, a 15 % reduction from 170 Pt per kWh of heat to 146 Pt per kWh of heat can be achieved. For scenario (B) with a doubled insulating cover for the seasonal storage unit, a 9 % reduction to 155[^note] Pt per kWh of heat can be achieved. This confirms the environmental impact savings potential of operating conditions improvements.

[^note]: This is coincidentally the exact same result as already obtained in @sec-pipe-loss.

# Summary and conclusion

A Life Cycle Impact Assessment was conducted for a solar district heating community project located in Bracht, Rauschenberg, Germany. This project combines solar thermal collectors with a seasonal storage unit to preserve heat produced in summer until the heating period in fall and winter. A heat transport network supplies the thermal energy to 180 residential consumers. The system's energy supply is expected to be 67% from stored solar thermal energy, 26% from biomass, and 6% from the electricity grid. Default modelling assumptions included a 20% heat loss coefficient for the transport network and an implied 50% loss for the seasonal storage unit.

Results indicate that biomass and grid electricity are the primary contributors to the overall environmental impact, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total, despite supplying only one-third of the energy delivered. The solar thermal collectors contribute less than 15% to the overall environmental impact. Analysis by damage categories shows biomass combustion significantly contributes to land use, particulate matter, and marine eutrophication, while electricity use is the main driver for fossil resource use and climate change. 

Comparing the Bracht system to other heating technologies, the STC-based district heating system with seasonal storage shows the second lowest environmental impact at approximately 170 Pt per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of heat, based on analysis using the Ecological Scarcity 2021 (v1.04) method. This is similar to district heating using wood chips (165 Pt/kWh), lower than a geothermal heat pump district heating system (225 Pt/kWh), and significantly lower than gas boilers (281 Pt/kWh) and oil boilers (430 Pt/kWh). 

Sensitivity analyses for the inputs biomass and electricity were performed to demonstrate the effects of generalizations and uncertainties in input data on the results, and to evaluate the potential for reducing environmental impact. The conclusion is that, while the Bracht solar district heating system compares favorably to many conventional and alternative heating technologies in terms of environmental impact, further improvements to the operating conditions are possible to achieve even lower environmental impact. Significant opportunities lie in sourcing lower-emission electricity for heat pump operation, which would help mitigate the environmental impact associated with the current and future electric grid mix. Purchasing renewable energy to operate the heat pump can achieve significant improvements. Furthermore, improving heat loss coefficients, particularly reducing the significant heat loss in the seasonal storage unit, could allow the system to meet consumer demand without any combustion of supplemental biomass over the winter heating period which would also achieve sizable savings in environmental impact. The first step towards achieving this is to use dedicated modelling tools to fully understand the impact of the different operating conditions on the energy balance to validate the preliminary findings of this study. In addition, since the plant will be entering the operational phase in late 2025, further analysis can be supported with run-time data collected from the functional system.
